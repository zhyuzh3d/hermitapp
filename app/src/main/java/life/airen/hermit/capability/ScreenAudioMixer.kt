 * The arithmetic behind the recording audio track.

 * Samples are interleaved little-endian 16-bit PCM, so one pass of addition covers any
 * channel count: the arithmetic never has to know whether it is mixing mono or stereo.
 * Mixing two sources that are both at full scale would wrap around and turn loud content
 * into noise, so the sum saturates instead.
