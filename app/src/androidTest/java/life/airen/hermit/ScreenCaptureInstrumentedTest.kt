/**
 * Screen capture and screen recording on the real device.
 *
 * Two things here cannot be proven from the JVM and cannot be proven by reading the code:
 *
 * 1. A projection is handed out only after the *user* answers a system dialog, and one consent
 *    buys exactly one virtual display. Nothing in the app can answer that dialog on the user's
 *    behalf, so these tests answer it through the shell, looking the button up in a fresh window
 *    dump every time — a remembered coordinate is wrong on the next ROM and wrong again after
 *    any layout change.
 * 2. The whole point of the feature is that it keeps running while the user is somewhere else.
 *    The recording test leaves Hermit entirely, and stops the recording *while* Hermit is in
 *    the background, which is the only way "captures the whole device screen, including other
 *    apps" means anything.
 *
 * While a dialog is up the test never touches the activity: it fires the JavaScript, answers the
 * dialogs through the shell, and only then reads the page back. A projection dialog pauses
 * MainActivity, and driving it through `ActivityScenario.onActivity` in that window would block
 * against the very result the dialog exists to deliver.
